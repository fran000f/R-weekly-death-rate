# R-weekly-death-rate
R Shiny application showing data on deaths in population of Poland and the EU. (in Polish)

The app lets the user download the data in question directly from the Polish GUS and EUROSTAT servers. Next, a database with processed data gets created, which the user can later browse through using SQL or display time series charts.
There are still problems with certain graphs and Google charts as of this commit.
